# Hola 👋

 I am Camila Duitama González
 - 🧬👩🏽‍💻I am currently working as a Research Engineer in the group of [Sebastian Duchene](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K7q8WywAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Evolutionary Dynamics of Infectious Diseases](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/member/sebastian-duchene-garzon/) at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, France.

 - My latest work is [muset](https://github.com/CamilaDuitama/muset)🌭, a software for generating an abundance unitig matrix from a collection of input samples (in FASTA/Q format).
 
 - 🧹🦷 I did my PhD on the development of algorithms that used machine learning and bloom filters on k-mer profiles to quantify and remove the contamination of ancient metagenomic data (see [decOM](https://github.com/CamilaDuitama/decOM) and [aKmerBroom](https://github.com/CamilaDuitama/aKmerBroom) ).
